What is a Data Pipeline and how to build one?

𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐔𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐄𝐓𝐋 𝐁𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐜𝐬:
𝘌𝘹𝘵𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘵: Get data from sources like data lake or file storage.
𝘛𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘴𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘮: Apply changes or filters to clean and organize the data.
𝘓𝘰𝘢𝘥: Save the processed data to a place where it can be used, like a database.

𝐂𝐡𝐨𝐨𝐬𝐞 𝐁𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐨𝐫 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐥-𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠:
Decide if you need to process data in batches (at intervals) or in real-time (as it comes in).

𝐈𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐲 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐒𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐜𝐞𝐬:
Find out where your data is coming from. It could be databases, file storage systems like AWS S3 or HDFS, or other sources.

𝐊𝐧𝐨𝐰 𝐘𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭:
Understand the format of your incoming data. Is it in JSON (flexible structure), CSV (rows and columns), or another format?

𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐃𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐒𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐦𝐚:
Look at your data to understand its structure and types. This helps in reading and processing it correctly.

𝐒𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐑𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐓𝐨𝐨𝐥𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:
Choose a processing framework like Apache Spark for batch processing or Apache Flink for real-time processing.

𝐃𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐝𝐞 𝐖𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚:
Choose a destination for your processed data. It could be a database, a data warehouse, or a file storage system.

𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐒𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐝𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐫 (𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥):
If you need to run your data pipeline at specific times, use a tool like Apache Airflow to schedule and automate this process.

𝐀𝐠𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐠𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐳𝐞 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚:
After processing, save your data in an organized way, like in folders sorted by date. Use tools like Hive to create tables from this data for analysis.

𝐏𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:
For a hands-on example: set up a system to process daily data. Use Hadoop for storage, Spark for processing, and Airflow for scheduling.
Transform the data according to your business needs and load it into a system for further analysis or reporting.

𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐀𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐏𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:
Set up external tables (using Hive, for example) to easily access and analyze the processed data.


Remember, the key to building an effective data pipeline is understanding your data and selecting the right tools and processes to handle it efficiently.
